            "Crocodiles have a special membrane that protects their eyes while underwater, allowing them to see clearly while hunting.",
            "They communicate using a variety of sounds, including hissing, growling, and even bellowing, especially during mating season.",
            "Unlike many reptiles, crocodiles exhibit parental care, with mothers often guarding their nests and helping hatchlings reach the water.",
            "Crocodiles are opportunistic feeders and can eat a wide range of prey, including fish, birds, and mammals.",
            "Their skin coloration helps them blend into their surroundings, making them effective ambush predators.",
            "Crocodiles can live for several decades, with some species known to live over 70 years in the wild.",
            "There are around 15 different species of crocodiles, including the Nile crocodile, saltwater crocodile, and American crocodile, each adapted to different environments."
